#Information:  This program creates a database of stats of all Gen 1 Pokemon, which includes base speed, special defense, special attack
#               defense, attack, and HP. We will calculate the average base stats for typings of Pokemon (fire, water, grass).
                #example: Which Pokemon type has the highest attack stat on average?
