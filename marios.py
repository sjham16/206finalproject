Project Members: Dylan Yono, SoJung Ham
About: This program collects data from the RAWG Video Games Database API.
It searches for Mario games published by Nintendo.
Then, it collects the game's rating (from RAWG users) and release date.
The information is put into a database and games are sorted by decade.
The program may visualize the average rating of each Mario game per decade.
The program may also write the data to a text file.
